Invertebrate Zoology is a textbook that covers the biology and evolution of invertebrate animals, which comprise more than 95% of all animal species on Earth. The book is written by Edward E. Ruppert, Richard S. Fox and Robert D. Barnes, who are experts in the field of invertebrate zoology. The book is intended for undergraduate students who are interested in learning about the diversity, morphology, physiology, ecology and behavior of invertebrates.

The book is divided into 19 chapters, each focusing on a major group of invertebrates or a theme related to their evolution. The book starts with an introduction to invertebrates and their phylogenetic relationships, followed by chapters on protozoa, sponges, cnidarians, ctenophores, bilaterians, platyhelminths, nemerteans, molluscs, annelids, arthropods, echinoderms, lophophorates and other coelomate worms. The book also covers topics such as patterns of invertebrate evolution, functional morphology, adaptive radiation, biogeography and conservation of invertebrates.
 
The book is well-illustrated with diagrams, photographs and tables that help explain the concepts and examples discussed in the text. The book also provides references for further reading and research at the end of each chapter. The book is updated with the latest scientific findings and incorporates recent advances in molecular biology, cladistics and phylogenetics. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and modern overview of invertebrate zoology that reflects the current state of knowledge and research in this field.

Invertebrate zoology is not only a fascinating subject for academic study, but also a field that has many practical applications and benefits for humans and the environment. Invertebrates provide essential ecosystem services, such as pollination, decomposition, soil formation, nutrient cycling, pest control, and food provision. They also contribute to scientific research, medicine, biotechnology, and education. Invertebrates are also indicators of environmental health and biodiversity, as they respond to changes in habitat quality, climate, and human impacts. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
 
However, despite their importance and diversity, invertebrates are often neglected or overlooked in conservation efforts. Many invertebrate species are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation, pollution, invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change. Some of these threats are directly caused by human activities, while others are indirect consequences of global environmental changes. The exact number of invertebrate species that are endangered or extinct is unknown, due to the lack of taxonomic knowledge and monitoring data. However, some estimates suggest that up to 40% of all invertebrate species may be at risk of extinction by the end of this century. [^3^]
 
Therefore, it is imperative to protect and conserve invertebrates and their habitats for their own sake and for the benefit of humans and other living beings. Invertebrate conservation requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves scientific research, education, public awareness, policy making, legislation, management, and restoration. It also requires collaboration among various stakeholders, such as governments, NGOs, academic institutions, local communities, landowners, and industries. Invertebrate conservation is not only a moral duty but also a smart investment for the future of our planet. [^3^]
